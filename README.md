# odin-recipes

This website consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The skills demonstrated in this project are basic HTML:
- lists
- links and images

Self-reflection:
I made three webpages, "matcha cheese cake," "tempura," and "miso soup." I linked these websites to "home" page.

Each recipe webpage contains:
- image (`<img>`)
- description (`<p>`)
- ingredient (`<ul>`)
- steps (`<ol>`)
- link to original recipe (`<a>`)
