        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Matcha Basque Burnt Cheesecake is creamy and custardy with caramel notes and an earthy sweetness. Its iconic deep-brown top contrasts beautifully with the vibrant green tea color inside. This Japanese-style cheesecake is lighter than the standard version and is surprisingly easy to make.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ lb cream cheese (1 block; I used Philadelphia brand; at room temperature) </li>
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk (at room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp matcha (to make a classic version without matcha, substitute with 1 Tbsp lemon juice instead)</li>
            <li>4 tsp cake flour (or use all-purpose flour; use rice flour for gluten-free)</li>
            <li>2 tsp cornstarch (or use all-purpose flour)</li>
            <li>220 ml heavy (whipping) cream (1 cup minus 4 tsp; at room temperature)</li>
            <li>⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
           <li>Preheat oven to 475ºF (245ºC).</li> 
           <li>Prepare the cake pan.</li>
           <li>Place ½ lb cream cheese in a large bowl.</li>
           <li>Press down on the cream cheese with a spatula to soften it. Then, add ½ cup sugar.</li>
           <li>Combine the cream cheese with the sugar by rubbing the mixture against the sides of the bowl with the spatula. The cream cheese will become fluffy and smooth as the sugar granules dissolve. </li>
           <li>In a separate bowl, whisk 2 large eggs (50 g each w/o shell) and 1 large egg yolk well.</li>
           <li>Slowly and gradually add one-third of the beaten eggs to the cream cheese mixture. Blend completely and thoroughly, making sure the batter is smooth and without lumps before adding more egg.</li>
           <li>Add another one-third of the eggs to the cream cheese mixture, blending completely.</li>
           <li>Add the remaining egg and blend well. </li>
           <li>Incorporate the Matcha</li>
           <li>Add 4 tsp cake flour and 2 tsp cornstarch to a fine-mesh sieve. Keep sifting and blending until you‘ve added all the flour mixture.</li>
           <li>Add 220 ml heavy (whipping) cream (1 cup minus 4 tsp) while you stir. Mix until it’s all combined.</li>
           <li>Add ⅛ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and blend it all together.</li>
           <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go) so you don't create any air pockets.</li>
           <li>Bake at 475ºF (245ºC) for a conventional oven. Bake until the top is dark amber/brown and the center is still very jiggly, about 30 minutes.</li>
           <li>To cool, place in the refrigerator for 4 hours.</li>
        </ol>
